## Features
- Open Source: I have no plans to change this ever though the github may not always be up to date. This includes the libraries as I build directly off the source of SilenceEngine and so the jar is not always up to date.
- Mod Support: Mod support is planned however when and if it ever gets implemented is completely up in the air. This also means it could be partialy added and then removed.
- TODO more stuff here

## Story
Nah won't post anything here . . . yet
